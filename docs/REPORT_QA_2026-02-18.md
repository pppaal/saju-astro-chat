# Report QA Guide (2026-02-18)

## Scope

- Target: themed premium reports
- Objective:
  - quantify report quality
  - expose full calculation evidence (Saju + Astrology) to the user

## Quality Dimensions

- `completenessScore`:
  - required sections coverage
  - themed required keys + theme-specific key
- `crossEvidenceScore`:
  - ratio of sections containing both Saju and Astrology evidence
- `actionabilityScore`:
  - action plan and recommendation sentence density
- `clarityScore`:
  - minimum section length and placeholder-pattern penalties
- `overallQualityScore`:
  - weighted aggregate:
    - completeness 30%
    - cross evidence 30%
    - actionability 25%
    - clarity 15%
    - small keyword bonus

## Grade Guide

- `90+`: Excellent
- `80-89`: Strong
- `70-79`: Acceptable
- `60-69`: Needs improvement
- `<60`: Rework recommended

## Operational Notes

- themed reports persist two new optional fields in `reportData`:
  - `qualityAudit`
  - `calculationDetails`
- result page allows:
  - markdown download for quality audit
  - JSON download for full calculation details

## Improvement Priority (when score is low)

1. Raise cross-evidence density first

- every section should include both Saju and Astrology basis

2. Raise actionability second

- strengthen concrete behavior guidance

3. Raise completeness third

- fill missing section keys for the selected theme

4. Improve clarity

- remove placeholders and increase section-level specificity
