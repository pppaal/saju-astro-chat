# Unicorn Strategy

Last audited: 2026-02-15 (Asia/Seoul)

This document tracks long-range product strategy and market assumptions. It is intentionally non-normative for runtime behavior.

## Strategic Themes

1. Product depth

- Keep cross-domain counseling quality high across saju, astrology, tarot, destiny-map
- Expand premium value through deterministic reports and explainable outputs

2. Platform reliability

- Preserve strict release gates (`lint`, `typecheck`, `build`, smoke/e2e)
- Keep API security posture measurable with automated audits

3. Monetization discipline

- Subscription + credits remain core model
- Measure retention and conversion changes before plan/pricing rollout

4. Distribution

- SEO content and referral loops
- Mobile packaging through Capacitor where required

## Guardrails

- Strategy claims must not override code truth.
- Current implementation details must always be verified in code and canonical operational docs.
