The Geokguk represents your soul's fundamental energy pattern, revealing the essence of your soul that has continued from past lives. There are 8 patterns: Siksin (Creator), Sanggwan (Revolutionary), Jeonggwan (Leader), Pyeongwan (Warrior), Jeongjae (Preserver), Pyeonjae (Adventurer), Jeongin (Sage), and Pyeongin (Mystic).",

      "nodesText": "In Western astrology, the North Node represents the direction your soul needs to develop in this life, while the South Node indicates patterns already familiar from past lives. The North Node's position shows the direction of your soul's evolution, helping you understand the habits carried from past lives and the new lessons to learn in this life.",
      "purposeTitle": "Saturn and Karmic Lessons",

Saturn's position shows the tasks left unfinished from past lives or the fears you need to overcome. The house containing Saturn is the area where you will experience the greatest maturity and growth, allowing you to repay karmic debts and evolve your soul."
