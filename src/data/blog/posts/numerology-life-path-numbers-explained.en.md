## What is Numerology?

Numerology is the ancient study of numbers and their mystical significance. It believes that numbers carry vibrational energies that influence our lives, personalities, and destinies.

## The Life Path Number

Your Life Path Number is the most important number in numerology. It reveals your life purpose, natural talents, and the opportunities and challenges you'll encounter.

### How to Calculate Your Life Path Number

Reduce your birth date to a single digit (or Master Number):

**Example: December 15, 1990**

- Month: 12 → 1 + 2 = 3
- Day: 15 → 1 + 5 = 6
- Year: 1990 → 1 + 9 + 9 + 0 = 19 → 1 + 9 = 10 → 1 + 0 = 1

Life Path = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 → 1 + 0 = **1**
