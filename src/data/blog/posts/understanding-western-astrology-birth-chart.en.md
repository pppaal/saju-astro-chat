## What is a Birth Chart?

A birth chart, also known as a natal chart, is a snapshot of the sky at the exact moment you were born. It shows the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and other celestial bodies relative to the Earth, mapped onto the 12 houses of the zodiac.

Think of it as your cosmic DNA—a unique blueprint that influences your personality, strengths, challenges, and life path.

## The Three Key Components

### 1. Sun Sign

Your Sun sign represents your core identity, ego, and life purpose. It's determined by the zodiac constellation the Sun occupied at your birth.

**The 12 Sun Signs:**

- **Aries** (Mar 21 - Apr 19): Bold, ambitious, pioneering

### 2. Moon Sign

Your Moon sign governs your emotional nature, instincts, and subconscious patterns. It reveals how you process feelings and what makes you feel secure.

### 3. Rising Sign (Ascendant)

Your Rising sign is the zodiac sign that was ascending on the eastern horizon at your birth. It represents your outer personality—how others perceive you and how you approach new situations.
