## Why Do We Dream?

Dreams have fascinated humanity since the beginning of recorded history. From ancient oracles to modern psychology, dreams have been seen as windows to our unconscious mind, messages from the divine, or processing of daily experiences.

While science continues to explore the biological purpose of dreams, many find that understanding dream symbolism provides valuable insights into their inner world.

## How to Interpret Dreams

### Keep a Dream Journal

Write down your dreams immediately upon waking. Include:

- Main symbols and characters
- Emotions felt during the dream
- Colors, numbers, and locations
- Any words spoken

### Consider Personal Context

Universal symbols have general meanings, but your personal associations matter more. A dog might represent loyalty to one person and fear to another based on their experiences.

### Look for Patterns

Recurring dreams or symbols often point to unresolved issues or important messages your subconscious is trying to communicate.
