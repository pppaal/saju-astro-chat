## Common Misinterpretations

### The Hermit ≠ Loneliness

The Hermit in love readings often means needed self-reflection or spiritual growth before partnership.

### Reversed Cards ≠ Bad

Reversals often indicate internal process, delays, or redirected energy—not necessarily negative outcomes.

### "Bad" Cards ≠ Doom

Challenging cards show what needs attention, not unchangeable fate.

## Conclusion

Tarot offers a mirror for your heart, reflecting both conscious desires and hidden patterns. Use love readings as tools for understanding and growth, not as predictive absolutes. The cards illuminate possibilities; you create your love story.
