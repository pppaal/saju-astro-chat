## Introduction to Saju (Four Pillars of Destiny)

Saju (사주, 四柱), also known as the Four Pillars of Destiny, is an ancient divination system that originated in China and has been practiced in Korea for over a thousand years. The term "Saju" literally translates to "four pillars," referring to the four components of your birth time: year, month, day, and hour.

## The Philosophy Behind Saju

At the core of Saju lies the concept of the Five Elements (五行, Ohaeng): Wood (木), Fire (火), Earth (土), Metal (金), and Water (水). These elements interact with each other in cycles of creation and destruction, influencing every aspect of our lives.

Each person's birth chart contains a unique combination of these elements, expressed through the Heavenly Stems (天干) and Earthly Branches (地支). The balance and interaction of these elements determine your:

- **Personality traits** and natural tendencies
- **Career aptitudes** and professional success
- **Relationship compatibility** with others
- **Health patterns** and vulnerabilities
- **Fortune cycles** throughout your life

## The Four Pillars Explained

### Year Pillar (年柱, Yeonju)

Represents your ancestral influences, social position, and early childhood environment. It shows how the world perceives you and your relationship with society.

### Month Pillar (月柱, Wolju)

Reflects your parents' influence, career path, and young adult life. This pillar often indicates your primary profession and public achievements.

### Day Pillar (日柱, Ilju)

The most important pillar—it represents your core self, your spouse, and your adult life. The Day Master (日主, Ilju) is considered your true essence.

### Hour Pillar (時柱, Siju)

Represents your children, creativity, later years, and legacy. It shows what you leave behind for future generations.

## How Saju Differs from Western Astrology

While both systems analyze birth time, Saju and Western Astrology have key differences:

| Saju                         | Western Astrology            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Based on lunar calendar      | Based on solar calendar      |
| Uses Five Elements theory    | Uses planetary influences    |
| 60-year cycle (sexagenary)   | 12-month zodiac cycle        |
| Focuses on elemental balance | Focuses on planetary aspects |
